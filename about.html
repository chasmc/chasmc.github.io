      <p class ="about-content">I'm a creative problem solver who loves coding design and designing code. I have been working with people all of my adult life and I continue to love working with others. On the surface, computers seem to have nothing to do with being a human, but people are really at the heart of web development. I am a tool builder, and I always have others in mind when designing. Another love of mine is music, and being part of a band for over 10 years has given me a unique perspective on finding creative solutions within the world of web development. Let me know if I can help you!</p>
