      <p class ="about-text">I'm a creative problem solver who loves coding design and designing code. I've been practicing and studying front end web development and design for over 3 years now. Most recently I graduated from the UI development/design program at the Iron Yard in Raleigh to gain the skills that are relevent for success in the 21st century. It was a 3 month immersive program where at minimum, I put in 50 hours a week. The Iron Yard not only gave me the technical skills to succeed, but it also taught me how to think and grow as a developer.<br><br>That gets to the heart of why I love UI development. There is always room to grow. I am also a musician, and one of the reasons I love music is that I never feel done. I can always learn and always explore. Coding and design are the same in that way. Once I am done, I've only just begun. <br> I look forward to working with you!</p>
