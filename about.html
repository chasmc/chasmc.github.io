      <p class ="about-text">I'm a creative problem solver who loves coding design and designing code. I live in Raleigh, North Carolina and I've been practicing and studying front end web development and design for over 3 years now. Working full time while trying to progress in web developement proved to be tough for me, so I decided to enroll in the UI development/design program at the Iron Yard in Raleigh. It was a 3 month immersive program where at minimum I put in 50 hours a week. The Iron Yard not only gave me the technical skills to succeed, but it also taught me how to think and grow as a developer.<br><br>That gets to the heart of why I love UI development. There is always room to grow. I'm a musician, and one of the reasons I love music is that it is an endless journey. You never arrive, but you try to. Coding and design feel the same way to me.<br> Let me know how I can help you!</p>
