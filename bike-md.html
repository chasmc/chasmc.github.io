        <p class ="challengestext">This project presented me with a few challenges. As the front end developer of a team of three (consisting of a UI designer and a back end developer) the main challenge was to find a way to collaborate and come away with a coherent, and user friendly, multi-paged web application. We overcame this challenge by delegating our roles from the get go and helping each other out when needed. Respecting each other's views while specializing in certain areas went a long way with this project. <br><br>Another challenge we had was to give the application an atmosphere that was modern and inviting while at the same time keeping it as streamlined as possible. After all, it is meant for bike techs on the job who need something that is intuitive and simple to use. We accomplished this by finding the right imagery to set the tone, and whenever we added a feature we asked ourselves, "Is this necessary?".</p>
