      <h4 class ="title">Summary</h4>
      <p class ="summarytext">A web application designed to foster a community of motorcycle technicians in order to assist each other with troubleshooting. I was the lead front-end developer on a team consisting of two front end designers / developers and one back end developer. This was a MVP final project for the Iron Yard and future plans to make it fully responsive and ready to launch are in the works.</p>

      <h4 class ="title">Challenges and Solutions</h4>
      <p class ="challengestext">This project presented me with a few challenges. As the front end developer of a team of three (consisting of a UI designer and a back end developer) the main challenge was to find a way to collaborate and come away with a coherent, and user friendly, multi-paged web application. We overcame this challenge by delegating our roles from the get go and helping each other out when needed. Respecting each other's views while specializing in certain areas went a long way with this project. <br><br>Another challenge I had as the lead front-end developer was to not only make the designs happen, but to take them to another level when necessary. I had alot of fun pushing myself with CSS3 transforms and transitions with this project and I am excited to keep exploring the possibilities!</p>
